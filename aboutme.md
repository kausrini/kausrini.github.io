Hey All,

I am Kaushik Srinivasan and I have been working in Information Security since 2018.

I have primarily worked on Incident Response for cloud environments (Amazon Web Services) and for  corporate environments (Amazon and LinkedIn). 

I will be using this platform to document my malware analysis journey. None of the content mentioned in this blogpost will be related to my employment and is intended solely for educational purposes.
