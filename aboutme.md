My name is Kaushik Srinivasan and I've worked in Information Security for around 3 years (as of May, 2021). 

I've primarily worked on Incident Response for cloud and corporate environments. As part of these roles, I am developing my Digital Forensics and Malware Analysis skillset.  

I have started to improve on my Malware Analysis/Reverse Engineering capabilities and will be using this platform to document my journey. None of the content mentioned in this blogpost will be related to my employment and is intended solely for educational purposes.
