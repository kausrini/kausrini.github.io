My name is Kaushik Srinivasan and I've worked in Information Security for around 3 years (as of May, 2021). 

I've primarily worked on Incident Response in the cloud (AWS) and corporate assets. The latter involved gaining experience in Digital Forensics and Malware Analysis.  

I have started to improve on my Reverse Engineering capabilities and will be using this platform to document my journey.
